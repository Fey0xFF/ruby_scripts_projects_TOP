As per the Odin Project asking to design your own versions of commonly used enumerables.

Project is to create your own custom enumerable module, include it into code and include it into other files as needed. Initial commits contain test code.

Note to self, captain's log: 11/15/17, after a month and a half into the Odin Project amidst other self-learning, I'm finally beginning to feel like a programmer. :)
